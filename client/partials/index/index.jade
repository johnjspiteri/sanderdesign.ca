			p “I would highly recommend Sander Design. They listened, were responsive to my needs and did not try to sell me stuff I did not want for the sake of it. In terms of the project… they are the only team I have worked with in a very long time that delivered as promised on time and budget.”

			p “Sander, you have transformed my rear yard in to an urban oasis; complete with a  water feature. It has become such a terrific space. I regularly receive comments such as “this looks like a magazine photo”, “wow, who designed your yard?”. My front yard is receiving similar positive feedback from passing pedestrians and neighbours; the comments are particularly focused on the unique, modern appearance. Well done Sander, thank you!”

{"category":"Residential","clean":"young-residence","description":"This garden had good bones to it when Sander Design got involved. The existing paving consists of a beautiful old credit valley stone that had a nice patina. The mature locust tree on site has a sculptural quality, because of its expressive bark, and the neighbouring heritage brick wall added a touch of history and class to the garden.  We felt like it would be a good idea to reflect some of those qualities in the garden and play off some of the existing textures.  The planting was cleaned up in favour of boxwoods, yews, and English ivy  with their subtle shades of green.  The perimeter fencing design mimics the language of the neighbouring brick wall with layered cedar wood elements stained black.  This approach makes the fence disappear into the background to allow the patio to stand out more.  The deck was renovated with a beautiful ioe wood , steps were widened and a new classic open style railing to better tie  the architecture of the house to the garden. Overall the garden has a renewed freshness to it and offers a beautiful retreat for a very busy client.","images":[{"base64":"","filename":"1.jpg","filesize":"459887","filetype":"image/jpeg"},{"base64":"","filename":"2.jpg","filesize":"459887","filetype":"image/jpeg"},{"base64":"","filename":"3.jpg","filesize":"459887","filetype":"image/jpeg"},{"base64":"","filename":"4.jpg","filesize":"459887","filetype":"image/jpeg"},{"base64":"","filename":"5.jpg","filesize":"459887","filetype":"image/jpeg"},{"base64":"","filename":"6.jpg","filesize":"459887","filetype":"image/jpeg"},{"base64":"","filename":"7.jpg","filesize":"459887","filetype":"image/jpeg"}],"location":{"city":"Toronto","country":"Canada","neighbourhood":"Deer Park","province":"Ontario"},"style":"","tags":["Zen","Design"],"title":"young-residence","thumb":{"base64":"","filename":"thumb.jpg","filesize":"459887","filetype":"image/jpeg"},"year":""}

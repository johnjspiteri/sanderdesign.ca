Even with small steps we can contribute to ensure sustainability. Every outdoor room with plant life brings nature back into our urban living environment. The sensitive choice of material and colour make these spaces healthier and liveable. The choice of the right plants, emphasizing on using sustainable organic materials and, wherever possible, choosing recycled or re-used commodities like salvage wood.
	p.tk-usual.desktop Sander Design has a great ambition towards outdoor living space and for their enormous potential to bring us peace and pleasure. Not only that outdoor rooms create an enhanced lifestyle and raises the bar of design it also can contribute to a sustainable living environment. Especially today where concrete and work define our lives, outdoor spaces are important in the health of the people. Little sanctuaries play an important role in healing our souls and find inner and outer peace. Experiencing wind, water, fresh air, sunshine and butterflies brings us back to our human roots. Through outdoor rooms and with a little effort we can bring nature into our homes and back into our lives.

	p.tk-usual No matter how large or small the exterior space is, there is always the possibility to transform it in a little oasis, even in the middle of a metropolitan city like Toronto. Based on simple principles, a combination of instinct and imagination, balanced with practical ideas and solutions, even a small balcony can turn into such an oasis. Outdoor space is an extension of the living area. With a well designed indoor â€“ outdoor connection it becomes a living experience. With a well thought design it even becomes an art and design statement.

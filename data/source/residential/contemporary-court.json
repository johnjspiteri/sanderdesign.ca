	"description": "This garden was designed to act as a small contemporary court yard to help soften the verticality of the house and accentuate it's clean and simple style as well as enhance is the sense of entry to the front door. Thin linear curbing stone lines on the ground are a nice contrast to the straight verticality of the house and soften it. The use of wood screens and ornamental grasses define the courtyard and give it a sense of privacy from the street without blocking the site lines.The wood storage shed and screens incorporate a matching contemporary horizontal pattern with a striking charcoal color to provide depth and contrary to light gravel stone and planting. The storage shed had a green roof that can be seen from the second floor windows. The sections of linear stone bands that curves it way to the front door helps define the sense of entry.",

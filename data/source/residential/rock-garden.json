	"description": "The challenge of this landscape design was that the house sits on a corner lot, where the longest side is adjacent a major road. It was important to provide the side of the house with an attractive feel and to buffer it from the road. The design solution was a rock garden that used hardy plants to tolerate the road pollution that helped marry the house with the ground in a natural and pleasing way.Intermittent layers of stone rockery were weaved into the hill to look like stone outcroppings ideal for planting pockets. Stone paving was used at ground level as a buffer between the rockery walls and the side walk to act as a natural transition between the public street scape and the property. Overall a natural yet slightly Asian feel was desired and is accentuated with the planting via evergreens, shrubbery and perennials.",
